quickMap-QV11
==============

This is a fork of Brian's QlikMap, note it does NOT include the KML features as I wanted simple multi layer mapping, however adding KML back should be easy enough at some stage

This will run at the moment but you need to ensure that your data is very well connected. I.e. you need to make sure that both layers are completly linked or the array will not build and the map will not display.
